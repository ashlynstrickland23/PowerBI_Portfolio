## 📊 Description  

This project demonstrates an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built for healthcare laboratory data. It highlights KPIs such as **compliance rate, turnaround time, test volumes, and critical vs. non-critical test counts**, providing stakeholders with actionable insights into lab performance and operations.  

**Tutorial Video:** This dashboard was developed as part of a **Power BI training tutorial** I created on YouTube to teach others how to build healthcare dashboards step-by-step.
