Welcome to my Power BI Portfolio Repository. This collection highlights the dashboards and analytics projects I’ve built to demonstrate my ability to transform raw, complex data into clear, actionable insights. Each project reflects my expertise in business intelligence, dashboard design, and data storytelling. Whether it’s finance, sales, marketing, or operations, my goal is always the same: to create tools that help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.

About Me

I’m Ashlyn Strickland, a data scientist with a Master’s degree in Data Science and certifications in Power BI, Tableau, Excel, Python, R, SQL, and Power Apps. My passion is taking messy, complex data and turning it into clear, visual stories that help organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions.

What You’ll Find

This repository highlights Power BI dashboards and DAX-driven analytics across finance, operations, sales, and retention. Projects include profit & loss statements, KPI scorecards, and drill-down reports optimized for both desktop and mobile. Each example showcases my ability to combine strong technical skills with business-focused storytelling.
