Welcome to my Power BI Portfolio Repository. This collection highlights the dashboards and analytics projects Iâ€™ve built to demonstrate my ability to transform raw, complex data into clear, actionable insights. Each project reflects my expertise in business intelligence, dashboard design, and data storytelling. Whether itâ€™s finance, sales, marketing, or operations, my goal is always the same: to create tools that help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.
