Welcome to my Power BI Portfolio Repository. This collection highlights the dashboards and analytics projects Iâ€™ve built to demonstrate my ability to transform raw, complex data into clear, actionable insights. Each project reflects my expertise in business intelligence, dashboard design, and data storytelling. Whether itâ€™s finance, sales, marketing, or operations, my goal is always the same: to create tools that help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.

# About Me

Iâ€™m Ashlyn Strickland, a data scientist with a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and certifications in Power BI, Tableau, Excel, Python, R, SQL, and Power Apps. My passion is taking messy, complex data and turning it into clear, visual stories that help organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions.

# What Youâ€™ll Find

This repository highlights Power BI dashboards and DAX-driven analytics across finance, operations, sales, and retention. Projects include profit & loss statements, KPI scorecards, and drill-down reports optimized for both desktop and mobile. Each example showcases my ability to combine strong technical skills with business-focused storytelling.

# ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Google Analytics Dashboard  

This **interactive Power BI dashboard** visualizes Google Analytics data to track key digital marketing performance metrics. The report provides a clear overview of **sessions, engagement rate, users, new users, bounce rate, total revenue, conversion rate, and purchases**.  

The dashboard is designed with two interactive views:  
- **Overview Page** â†’ Engagement trends, traffic source breakdown, and geographical analytics.  
- **User Behavior Page** â†’ Session duration, pages per session, bounce rate by traffic source, and engagement by device type.  

With dynamic slicers for **country, campaign, and date**, this solution allows stakeholders to drill into KPIs and uncover actionable insights for marketing strategy and audience engagement.  

**Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Excel
